              Staying sober is not easy. It requires a change of habits. These
              habits might have been ingrained in our brains for a long time. We
              also have to question our surroundings and become more aware of
              potential triggers.

              Changing your lifestyle is difficult. There will be times where we
              feel bad and question our choices. During these times it is
              important to have support and reassurance.
